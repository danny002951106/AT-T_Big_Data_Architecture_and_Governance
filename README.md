### 1.  Impact Statement
### Project Name: Predicting Network Outages

- Problem:
The inability to predict congestion causes network downtime and hampers end-user experience.
Poor incident management leads to decreased customer satisfaction and potential loss of clientele.
Strategic planning is essential to address high bandwidth usage or sudden spikes in network demand.
- Action:
Implementation of predictive models utilizing AI and statistical algorithms to bolster our End-to-End Incident Management platform.
Analysis of extensive network data to anticipate and mitigate potential outages, enhancing network reliability.
Collaboration with Network Engineers and the Chief Data Office to fortify our security incident response strategies.
- Result:
Improved customer retention through proactive identification and mitigation of network congestion-related outages.


### 2. Impact Statement
### Project Name: Improving AT&Tâ€™s Annual Free Cash Flow

- Problem:
The shortfall in annual cash flow for Q42022 by $2 billion compared to forecasts, resulting in a notable drop in share price.
Rigid subscription plans present challenges for subscribers amidst economic downturns, affecting payment patterns.
- Action:
In-depth analysis of consumer data and deployment of machine learning algorithms to tailor personalized subscription plans.
Development of systems to categorize consumers based on payment habits, offering flexible payment options to enhance satisfaction and retention.
Implementation of automated subscription charge debits to mitigate payment defaults and improve cash flow predictability.
- Result:
Decreased payment defaults and enhanced free cash flow management for AT&T.
